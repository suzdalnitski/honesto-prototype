Due to the limited amount of time available to work on this prototype, I've had to make some tradeoffs

# Features omitted
Logging in
View Submission - non-essential because the data can be viewed on the "team feedback" page
Skipping feedback
Notification count is non-functional

# Tradeoffs made

## Testing
## Performance
## Non-functional mockups
Many of the UI elements in the prototype are simple mockups, which are non-functional
